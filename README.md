# Scoreboard App with React Context API (React)

This project demonstrates how to manage global state in React using the `useContext` hook. It’s a simple and interactive scoreboard that allows users to increase or decrease the score by 10 points, with dynamic content based on the score. By using React's Context API, we manage the score state centrally and make it accessible across different components.

## Features

- **Score management**: Increase or decrease the score using buttons.
- **Global state with Context API**: Manage the score across the app using `useContext` and `useState`.
- **Dynamic UI**: Display dynamic messages based on the current score, such as "Let's make it over 100!" and "Good job!" when the score exceeds 100.
- **Clean architecture**: Used separate components and context to keep the codebase organized.
